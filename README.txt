My website is based on aa existing sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. It's a continuous scrolling website with five sections:
Home - with the restaurant name, background image, fixed navigation bar, and a "button" to acces the menu;
Menu - it's a dinamic table looking section using JS for changing pages
About - with some text about the restaurant and some images;
Contact - it's form section where user can send an email to the restaurant, the form is processed by php code;
Footer - just a formal footer

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.
Technical validation used.
I think a have covered all the main features needed by the situation and it's suitable for the audience and it's user-friendly in my opinion.
The webpage is compatible with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mobile devices, where I personally tested.
