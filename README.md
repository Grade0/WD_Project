<b>PROJECT TEXT:</b> [PDF](https://github.com/Grade0/WD_Project/raw/main/COMP20030-Project-2020.pdf)

<b>See the [[DEMO](https://davidechen.it/WD_Project)]</b>

The project is composed by:    
- 1 HTML file    
- 2 CSS files
- 1 JavaScript file
- 1 PHP file    
- an "images" folder    

My website is based on an existing sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. It's a continuous scrolling website with five sections:
Home - with the restaurant name, background image, fixed navigation bar, and a "button" to acces the menu;
Menu - it's a dinamic table looking section using JS for changing pages
About - with some text about the restaurant and some images;
Contact - it's form section where user can send an email to the restaurant, the form is processed by php code;
Footer - just a normal footer

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.
Technical validation used.
I think a have covered all the main features needed by the situation and it's suitable for the audience and it's user-friendly in my opinion.
The webpage is compatible with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mobile devices, where I personally tested.
